        </li>

        <li>Each edit or annotation of a cell may be made public, including your username, date and time of the edit or
          annotation,
          and possibly information about that cell, consistent with the concept of authorship. Your edits and
          annotations are not

          proofreading
          completion
          and cell name if known.</li>

        <li>FlyWire may place small files on your computer's hard drive known as “cookies,” in order to personalize your
          visits to

          abusive behavior; create a false identity; disseminate or transmit spam, advertisements, or solicitations;
          post material
          that infringes a copyright, trademark or patent right, trade secret or other legal right of any person,
          corporation or
          institution; collect, print out, reproduce, distribute, or otherwise make available or use outside of FlyWire

      <h2 style="text-align:center;">2. Privacy Notice</h2>

      <p>FlyWire.ai (“FlyWire” or the “Site”) respects and protects the privacy of your personal data. This notice
        contains
        information about how and why FlyWire collects your personal data and what we do with that information.</p>
      <p>
      <ol type="I">
        <li class='boldline'>What constitutes “Community Data”?
          <p>If you are a professional scientist, we
            request your real name, email address, institution, city, lab head name, and
            research interests, and will consider this information “Community Data”, to be shared among FlyWire users
            for purposes
            including communication and collaboration. If you are not a scientist, you may choose to volunteer your real
            name for
            credit attribution, in which case the information will be treated as community data. Cell edits within
            FlyWire are not
            considered Community Data, and are openly visible to all users. Cells marked for public release outside
            FlyWire will be
            associated with the names of users who contributed to those reconstructions, for credit attribution, which
            will not be
            considered Personal Data.</p>
        </li>
        <li class='boldline'>What Constitutes “Personal Data”?
          <p>FlyWire may collect personal data about you, including your name, email
            address, IP Address, URL requests (including
            time, method, and status code), URL that referred you to the Site, number of bytes transferred, web browser,
            operating
            system, and hardware platform. Cell edits within FlyWire are not considered Personal Data, and are openly
            visible to all
            users.</p>
        </li>
        <li class='boldline'>How We Collect Community and Personal Data
          <p>The personal data that FlyWire holds about you is obtained from a number of
            sources including information you supply at
            the time of registration, site usage statistics, and the <a href="http://flywire-forum.slack.com">FlyWire
              Forum</a>. FlyWire reserves the right to record
            communications on the <a href="http://flywire-forum.slack.com">FlyWire Forum</a>. These may be made public,
            omitting your personal information.</p>
        </li>
        <li class='boldline'>Why We Process Community and Personal Data
          <p>Our primary reasons for collecting and using Community and Personal Data
            include, but are not limited to, facilitating
            collaboration between you and other users, helping users conduct scientific research, assessing site usage,
            improving
            the Site, mediating between users, and granting credit for work done. When you use FlyWire, you agree that
            we can
            process Community Data and your Personal Data for administrative and collaborative purposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li class='boldline'>Sending Personal Data to Other Countries
          <p>In certain circumstances, personal data may be transferred to countries
            outside of the United States, including
            countries which may not have data protection laws that offer the same protections as your home country.
            Examples of
            circumstances when personal data may be transferred outside the U.S. include:
          <ul>
            <li>Mediating between users.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The European Commission has produced a list of countries which, according to the Commission, have adequate
            data
            protection rules. The list can be found here: <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-
            transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm'>http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-
              transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm.</a></p>
          <p>If the country that we are sending your information to is not on the list, or is not a country within the
            EEA (which
            means the EU, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland), then it might not have the same level of protection for
            personal data
            as the EU provides.</p>
          <p>Upon request, we will provide you with additional information about the safeguards which FlyWire has in
            place outside of
            this privacy notice. If you have any questions about the safeguards that are in place, please contact
            <a href="mailto: flywire@princeton.edu">flywire@princeton.edu</a>.</p>

            promotional
            materials, and other locations outside the Site. Community and Personal Data associated with your login
            email or your IP

        <li class='boldline'>Our Legal Basis for Processing Your Community and Personal Data Under GDPR
          <p>This notice complies with the European Union’s (“EU’s”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This
            regulation may
            apply to the processing of personal information that you provide FlyWire <u>while you are in the EU</u>, but
            it
            does not apply
            to information that you provide <u>while you are in the U.S.</u>.</p>
