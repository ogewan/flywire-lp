      <h1>FlyWire Principles</h1>
      <p><i>By the use of flywire.ai, you agree to be bound by these Principles and by the website
          <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a>.</i>
      </p>
      <h2>Community principles</h2>
      <p><i>Openness</i>. All results of proofreading are immediately available to all members of the FlyWire community.
        All researchers in fly neurobiology laboratories are welcome to apply.</p>
      <p><i>Fairness</i>. Before using previously unpublished reconstructions in a presentation or scientific
        publication, users must obtain
        agreement from every lab that identified those cells or contributed more than 10% of the edits on those
        reconstructions,
        or assessed them to be adequately complete according to community standards. This applies to FlyWire cells
        themselves
        and also to the use of FlyWire data for any purpose. (For example, this applies to cells reconstructed in other
        EM
        software platforms using FlyWire data for guidance.) When contacting FlyWire users to seek their agreement for
        the use
        of cells they contributed to, a lack of response within one month may be taken as agreement. Contributors may
        request
        co-authorship or acknowledgments, with the understanding that a few hours or days of work may not constitute
        authorship,
        but that many days or months of work most likely would. In addition, it is important for the advancement of
        science that
        contributors not block publication for others - if a block to publication is requested, an appeal can be raised
        with the
        advisory board, who will consider factors such as research interests and relative contributions of the labs
        involved.
        Early and active collaboration between users is encouraged to prevent disputes.</p>
      <p>To publish neurons from FlyWire, a member lab must submit a list by emailing flywire@princeton.edu or through a
        planned
        online submission system, and then must make that list available in the paper. The list should include segment
        IDs plus
        coordinates of a point in each nucleus, or if no nucleus is present, a point in a main branch. Once FlyWire
        neurons are
        published, they are available for free use with appropriate citations, without soliciting the agreement of
        FlyWire users
        who contributed to the published versions of those neurons. (If a neuron is edited after publication, the use of
        its
        post-publication edited version is subject to the agreement of contributors as described for unpublished neurons
        above.)</p>
      <p><i>Communication</i>. Labs are encouraged to communicate with each other early in a project through chat,
        email, and other
        channels.
        Coordination of reconstruction and analysis activities will increase the pace of discovery. Members may not
        share information with any individual who has not been granted access or agreed to these Principles. All active
        members and their PIs must sign onto the FlyWire Forum frequently to check for announcements and collaborative
        communications from other members.</p>
      <p><i>Mutual respect</i>. We should all respect each others’ efforts to achieve the common goal of understanding
        the fly nervous system. Mutual respect fosters a win-win situation, and generates synergy that lifts everybody
        up.</p>
      <h2>Design principles</h2>
      <p><i>Wikipedia-style crowd wisdom</i>. Anyone is permitted to edit anything. We believe this approach will yield
        accuracy, once we find the appropriate checks and balances.
      </p>
      <p><i>Social before technological solutions</i>. Prototyping of workflows should focus on getting the human
        element
        correct, using “low-tech” means like Google Docs and Sheets for coordination. Later on, workflows will be
        implemented by the engineering team as integrated features of the FlyWire site.</p>
      <p><i>Cultural norms over formal laws</i>. The FlyWire community should establish a good culture from the outset.
        Formal laws will be introduced when necessary but ideally will be kept to a minimum.</p>
