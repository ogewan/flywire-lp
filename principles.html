      <h1>FlyWire Principles</h1>
      <p><i>By the use of flywire.ai, you agree to be bound by these Principles and by the website
          <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a>.</i>
      </p>
      <h2>Community principles</h2>
      <p><i>Openness</i>. All results of proofreading are immediately available to all members of the FlyWire community.
        All researchers in fly neurobiology laboratories are welcome to apply.</p>
      <p><i>Fairness</i>. Before using previously unpublished reconstructions in a presentation or scientific
        publication, users must obtain agreement from every principal investigator whose lab identified those neurons or
        contributed more than 10% of the edits on those reconstructions. A lack of response within one month may be
        taken as agreement. Contributors may request co-authorship or acknowledgments, or may agree to share their work
        freely. The directors of FlyWire may provide arbitration but encourage early and active collaboration between
        users to prevent disputes. </p>
      <p><i>Communication</i>. Labs are encouraged to communicate with each other through chat, email, and other
        channels.
        Coordination of reconstruction and analysis activities will increase the pace of discovery. Members may not
        share information with any individual who has not been granted access or agreed to these Principles. All active
        members and their PIs must sign onto the FlyWire Forum frequently to check for announcements and collaborative
        communications from other members.</p>
      <p><i>Mutual respect</i>. We should all respect each others’ efforts to achieve the common goal of understanding
        the fly nervous system. Mutual respect fosters a win-win situation, and generates synergy that lifts everybody
        up.</p>
      <h2>Design principles</h2>
      <p><i>Wikipedia-style crowd wisdom</i>. Anyone is permitted to edit anything. We believe this approach will yield
        accuracy, once we find the appropriate checks and balances.
      </p>
      <p><i>Social before technological solutions</i>. Prototyping of workflows should focus on getting the human
        element
        correct, using “low-tech” means like Google Docs and Sheets for coordination. Later on, workflows will be
        implemented by the engineering team as integrated features of the FlyWire site.</p>
      <p><i>Cultural norms over formal laws</i>. The FlyWire community should establish a good culture from the outset.
        Formal laws will be introduced when necessary but ideally will be kept to a minimum.</p>
